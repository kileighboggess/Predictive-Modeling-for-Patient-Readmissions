# Predictive-Modeling-for-Patient-Readmissions
This project demonstrates the power of data analytics and machine learning in healthcare. By identifying high-risk patients, healthcare providers can take proactive measures to reduce readmissions and improve patient care. The techniques used here can be applied to other predictive modeling tasks in healthcare and beyond.
