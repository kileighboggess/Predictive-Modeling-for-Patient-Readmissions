# Predictive Modeling for Patient Readmissions

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting patient readmissions within 30 days of discharge using the **Diabetes 130-US Hospitals Dataset**. The goal is to identify high-risk patients and provide actionable insights to healthcare providers to improve patient outcomes and reduce costs.

## Key Steps
1. **Data Preprocessing:** Handled missing values, encoded categorical variables, and addressed class imbalance using SMOTE.
2. **Model Building:** Trained and compared **XGBoost** and **Random Forest** models.
3. **Results:** Achieved an ROC-AUC score of [insert score] with XGBoost and [insert score] with Random Forest.
4. **Visualizations:** Created confusion matrices and feature importance plots.
