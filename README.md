# Predictive Modeling for Patient Readmissions

I’m excited to share my latest data analytics project, where I built and compared XGBoost and Random Forest models to predict patient readmissions within 30 days of discharge using the Diabetes 130-US Hospitals Dataset. Here’s a quick overview of what I accomplished:

# ✅ Data Preprocessing:

* Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset, handling missing values and converting categorical variables into dummy variables.
Addressed class imbalance using SMOTE to ensure a balanced dataset for modeling.

# ✅ Model Building & Comparison:

* Trained an XGBoost model and a Random Forest model to predict patient readmissions.
Achieved an ROC-AUC score of 0.89 with XGBoost and 0.93 with Random Forest.
Compared the performance of both models using ROC-AUC and F1-score.

# ✅ Key Insights:

Identified the top 10 features driving readmissions, including factors like number of inpatient visits, medication use, and age.
Visualized the models’ performance using confusion matrices and feature importance plots.
